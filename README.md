# Spintronics_Project
GitHub repository for the Spintronic Projecy of group 22.

Here a brief introduction to the various scripts you can find in the repository:

- "P1.ipynb": first point of the excercise. It is a standalone Jupyter Notebook, requires Ubermag.

- "P2.ipynb": second point of the excercise. It is a standalone Jupyter Notebook, requires Ubermag.

- "P3.ipynb": third point of the excercise. It is a standalone Jupyter Notebook, requires Ubermag.

- "iteratingP2.py" and "iteratingP3.py" are used to simulate second and third problem in batch, from a list of parameters.

- "checkSimulation.ipynb" is a tool to import data from a simulation and do various data analysis routines, partially redundant with the standalone scripts but useful to access data without running simulations.

- "transmission_plot.ipynb" is a tool that imports a .csv file generated by "iteratingP3.py" to plot transmissions, needed for the third point of the excercise.
